Independence Testing
********************
Dodiscover experimentally provides an interface for conditional independence
testing and conditional discrepancy testing (also known as k-sample conditional
independence testing).

Conditional Independence Testing
================================

Testing for conditional independence among variables is a core part
of many data analysis procedures.

Conditional k-sample testing
============================

Testing for conditional discrepancy among variables is a core part
of many causal inference procedures, such as constraint-based structure
learning.

Utilities
