Version 0.1
===========

Here's the revised version:

The first release of pywhy-stats! This version offers several implementations for both conditional and unconditional
independence testing using various methods, including kernel independence tests, Bregman discrepancy tests and
Fisher Z tests.
Additionally, it introduces two methods for conditional two-sample testing using kernels and mutual information.
The conditional two-sample focuses on the conditional distributions, in contrast to the traditional unconditional
two-sample testing methods.
